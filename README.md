********************************FALCON X THE GAME***********************************
Our team has decided to create a simple and good taste "arcade" type of game.
The game starts with our "Falcon X" spaceship that encounters a variety of asteroids in outerspace.
The orientation of space ships's shooting angle is directed by the mouse coursor and shooting is activated by left mouse click.
Depends on how many asteroids are destroyed for the player's score to go up and go to next level.
Spaceship's health and mana will be displayed the entire game on the bottom side of the screen.
